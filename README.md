## Purpose

This repository contains some examples of wercker.yml files, written purely to illustrate a feature of either the yml DSL or the Wercker CLI.

## Running the examples

Each example is in its own directory and contains a `run.sh` file that will run the example locally, provided that the Wercker CLI and Docker are installed. Each example also has its own `README.md` with some useful documentation.
